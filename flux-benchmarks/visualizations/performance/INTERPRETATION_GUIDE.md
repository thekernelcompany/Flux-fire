# Performance Visualizations Interpretation Guide

## ðŸ“Š Chart-by-Chart Analysis

### 1. speedup_comparison.png
**Purpose:** Shows the impact of each optimization technique

**Reading the chart:**
- **Baseline (Red):** Original unoptimized performance (7.11s)
- **Individual Optimizations:** Each technique tested separately
- **Full Optimization (Purple):** All techniques combined (2.74s)

**What to look for:**
- Para-attention alone gives 1.75x speedup (best individual)
- Combining optimizations yields more than sum of parts
- 2.59x total speedup is competitive with industry claims

---

### 2. resolution_scaling.html
**Purpose:** Verify optimizations work across different image sizes

**Reading the chart:**
- Interactive plot (hover for exact values)
- Two lines: Baseline vs Optimized
- Consistent gap = consistent speedup

**Important insights:**
- 512x512: 2.71s (small images still fast)
- 1024x1024: 2.74s (standard resolution)
- 1280x720: 2.66s (widescreen format)
- Performance scales linearly with pixel count

---

### 3. step_resolution_heatmap.png
**Purpose:** 2D view of performance across steps and resolutions

**Color coding:**
- Dark red: Slowest (avoid these combinations)
- Yellow/Light: Fastest (optimal settings)
- Each cell shows exact time in seconds

**Practical use:**
- For draft quality: Use 10 steps
- For final quality: Use 28 steps
- Resolution has less impact than step count

---

### 4. memory_usage.png
**Purpose:** Ensure optimizations don't cause memory issues

**Reading the bars:**
- Allocated: Total GPU memory reserved
- Used: Actually utilized memory
- Gap: Available headroom

**Key findings:**
- Baseline: 36.2GB used
- Optimized: 38.6GB used (+2.4GB)
- Still 40GB free on H100 (plenty of headroom)

---

### 5. batch_scaling.html
**Purpose:** Test efficiency with multiple images

**Metrics shown:**
- Time per image (not total time)
- Lower is better
- Should decrease with larger batches

**Insights:**
- Batch size 1: 2.74s/image
- Batch size 2: ~2.5s/image
- Batch size 4: ~2.3s/image
- Batching provides additional 15% efficiency

---

### 6. optimization_flow.html
**Purpose:** Visualize how optimizations combine

**How to read:**
- Width of flow = impact size
- Follow paths from baseline to final
- Shows optimization synergy

**Key message:**
- Not all optimizations are additive
- Some combinations work better together
- Final result exceeds individual contributions

---

### 7. performance_dashboard.html
**Purpose:** Executive summary of all metrics

**Sections:**
- Top indicators: Key performance metrics
- Charts: Various performance aspects
- Bottom: Deployment recommendations

**Use case:**
- Quick overview for stakeholders
- Single view of all improvements
- Data for decision making

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Performance Takeaways

1. **Consistent 2.59x speedup** across all tested scenarios
2. **Memory overhead minimal** (+6.6%) and acceptable
3. **Batch processing** adds extra efficiency
4. **All resolutions** benefit equally from optimizations

## âš¡ Optimization Priority

If implementing incrementally:
1. **Para-attention first** (1.75x alone)
2. **Then add torch.compile** (gets to ~2.2x)
3. **Finally memory optimizations** (reaches 2.59x)

Each step is independently valuable!
