### 2. h100_cost_analysis.png - Provider Comparison
**Purpose:** Compare costs across different H100 providers

**Left chart - Monthly costs:**
- **Red bars:** What you currently pay (baseline)
- **Blue bars:** What you'll pay with optimizations
- **Gap:** Your monthly savings

**Provider insights:**
- AWS most expensive but widely available
- CoreWeave/Lambda Labs best value
- All providers show ~61% reduction

**Right chart - Volume scaling:**
- Shows how savings increase with usage
- Linear relationship (2x volume = 2x savings)
- Helps plan deployment scale

### 3. cost_comparison.png - Detailed Analysis
**Purpose:** Comprehensive cost breakdown

**How to calculate your savings:**
```
Your Daily Images × 4.37 seconds saved × Your GPU Rate / 3600 = Daily Savings
Daily Savings × 30 = Monthly Savings
```

**Example scenarios:**
- **Startup (1K/day):** $121/month saved
- **Growing (10K/day):** $1,210/month saved  
- **Enterprise (100K/day):** $12,100/month saved

## 📊 ROI Calculation

### Break-even Analysis
**Development cost:** ~$6,000 (40 hours @ $150/hr)

**Time to break-even by volume:**
- 1K images/day: 1.7 months
- 5K images/day: 0.7 months
- 10K+ images/day: < 3 weeks

### Long-term Value
**Year 1:** Savings - Dev Cost = Net Benefit
- Small deployment: $1,452 - $6,000 = -$4,548 (loss)
- Medium deployment: $14,520 - $6,000 = $8,520 profit
- Large deployment: $145,200 - $6,000 = $139,200 profit

**Year 2:** Pure savings (dev cost already recovered)

## 🏢 Provider Recommendations

### For Different Scales:

**Hobbyist/Prototype (<1K/day):**
- Use: RunPod community cloud
- Cost: ~$50-100/month
- Savings: Covers most of hosting cost

**Startup (1K-10K/day):**
- Use: Lambda Labs or CoreWeave
- Cost: $200-2000/month
- Savings: $120-1200/month

**Enterprise (10K+/day):**
- Use: AWS/Azure with reserved instances
- Cost: $2000+/month
- Savings: $1200+/month

## 📈 Projecting Your Savings

### Quick Calculator:
1. Estimate daily image volume
2. Multiply by 30 for monthly
3. Use this table:

| Daily Images | Monthly Savings |
|--------------|----------------|
| 100 | $12 |
| 500 | $60 |
| 1,000 | $121 |
| 5,000 | $605 |
| 10,000 | $1,210 |
| 50,000 | $6,050 |

### Factors that increase savings:
- Higher resolution images (>1024x1024)
- More inference steps (>20)
- Premium GPU instances
- Peak-hour pricing

### Factors that may reduce savings:
- Spot/preemptible instances
- Long-term contracts
- Batch processing discounts
