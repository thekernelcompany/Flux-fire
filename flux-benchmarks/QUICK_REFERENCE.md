## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

```python
# The 4 key optimizations:
1. apply_cache_on_pipe(pipe, residual_diff_threshold=0.12)  # Para-attention
2. torch.compile(transformer, mode="max-autotune")          # Compilation  
3. transformer.to(memory_format=torch.channels_last)        # Memory layout
4. transformer.fuse_qkv_projections()                       # Operation fusion
```
